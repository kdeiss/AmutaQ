# restore backups to a specific ESXi host
# first run ./vm_prep_restore. This will create a list of all your backups.
# At the end this script will present the generated list in your favorite editor.
# Select your machines by removing the # at the begin of each line. You can select multiple machines at one time.
# The generated files you may find here: /tmp/lamw_restore_full.conf and /tmp/lamw_restore.conf
# Run this script. If you are connected via ssh consider to run it in screen because it may run long time if you select MYRESTOREMODE=1.
# In RESTOREMODE=0 it will just copy your machine definition (VMX file) to MYTARGETSERVER and create a link to your Harddisks on the NFS Share.
# It will make further adjustments to the VMX file and create a local(!) snapshot, so that there are no write operations to the NFS disk.
# Of course your machines will run significantly slow in this mode, but you can check functionality of your backups 
# You may find all events logged to /var/log/lamw_restore.log
